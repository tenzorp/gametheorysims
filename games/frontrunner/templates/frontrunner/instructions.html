            &emsp;In this study, you will be anonymously matched with another player. You will interact
            only via the computer and will not know which other student you are matched with.
            Each player will be randomly assigned a role: <b>Row</b> or <b>Column</b>. You can think of the two
            players as competing politicians. The Row player's job is to choose a political platform:
            “Extreme,” “Moderate,” or “Vague.” The Column player's job is to choose how to address
            the row player: "Challenge," "Ignore," or "Praise." You will learn of the other player's
            decisions after both of you have made your choices.
            <br/>
            &emsp;Based on the decisions you each make, one player will gain in the polls while the other player
            experiences an equivalent loss in the polls. The payoffs reflect the changes in the polls.
