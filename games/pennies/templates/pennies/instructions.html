            &emsp;This experiment has 3 stages. In each stage, you will be matched with another student in the room and
            play 4 rounds in each stage with the same partner. After each stage, you will be matched with a new partner.
            <br/>
            &emsp;<b>Stage 1:</b> In this game, one student will be assigned the role of the <b>Row Player</b> and the other will be
            assigned the role of the <b>Column Player</b>. Each simultaneously makes a choice between “Heads” and “Tails.” If
            the two players’ choices match, the Row Player earns a payoff of 1, while the Column Player earns a payoff
            of 0. If the choices mismatch, the Row Player earns a payoff of 0, while the Column Player earns a payoff of
            1.
            <br/>
            &emsp;The payoffs for both players are listed below for each case.

                <thead>
                    <tr>

                        <th colspan="3" scope="col" class="text-center">Column<br></th>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Heads</th>
                        <td>(1, 0)</td>

            </table>

            &emsp;<b>Stage 2:</b> You now will be matched with a new partner and play a very similar game. The only difference
            is in the Row Player’s payoff if the choices match on Heads. In this case, Row earns a payoff of 9. The
            payoffs for all of the other outcomes and for Column are otherwise identical. This game is shown below.

            outcomes and for Column are otherwise identical. This game is shown below.
