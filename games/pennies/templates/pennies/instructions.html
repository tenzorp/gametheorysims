            &emsp;This experiment has 3 stages. In each stage, you will be matched with another student in the room and
            play 4 rounds in each stage with the same partner. After each stage, you will be matched with a new partner.
            &emsp;Stage 1: In this game, one student will be assigned the role of the Row Player and the other will be
            assigned the role of the Column Player. Each simultaneously makes a choice between “Heads” and “Tails.” If
            the two players’ choices match, the Row Player earns a payoff of 1, while the Column Player earns a payoff
            of 0. If the choices mismatch, the Row Player earns a payoff of 0, while the Column Player earns a payoff of
            1.
            <br>
            &emsp;The payoffs for both players are listed below for each case.

            &emsp;Stage 2: You now will be matched with a new partner and play a very similar game. The only difference
            is in the Row Player’s payoff if the choices match on Heads. In this case, Row earns a payoff of 9. The
            payoffs for all of the other outcomes and for Column are otherwise identical. This game is shown below.

            &emsp;Stage 3: You now will be matched with a new partner and play a very similar game to the first two. In
            this game, Row earns a payoff of 0.50 if the two player both choose Heads. The payoffs for all of the other
            outcomes and for Column are otherwise identical. This game is shown below.
