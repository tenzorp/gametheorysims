            &emsp;You will now play a game with the other members of the class. Each person will guess a number from 0 to
            {{ group.endowment }}, with up to three decimal places. After everyone has submitted their number, we will
            compute the average (mean) of everyoneâ€™s guesses. The person whose number is closest to two-thirds of this
            average wins the game.
            <br/>
            &emsp;After entering your number, you will learn the average of the guesses, two-thirds of the average, and
            whether you won the game.
