            In this study, you will be anonymously matched with another player. You will interact
            only via the computer and will not know which other student you are matched with.
            Imagine that you and the other player are partners in crime and you must each decide
            whether to confess or to remain silent. You will each make this choice independently,
            without knowing what the other player has chosen.

            The outcome of the game is how many years in prison each player must serve. Thus,
            higher numbers signify worse outcomes.
            <ul>
                <li>If you both choose to remain silent then you each serve 1 year.</li>
                <li>If you both choose to confess then you each serve 5 years.</li>
                <li>If one player chooses to remain silent while the other chooses to confess then the
        player who remained silent serves 10 years while the player who confessed serves 0 years.</li>
            </ul>
