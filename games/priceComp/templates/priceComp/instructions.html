            In this study, you will be anonymously matched with another player. You will interact
            only via the computer and will not know which other student you are matched with.
            Each player represents a separate firm. Your job is to choose the price for your product:
            either $1, $2, or $3. Your payoff will depend on your choice and whether your partner chose
            an equal, lower, or higher price. If you make sales, your payoff is higher when you choose
            a higher price. You will learn of your partner's decision after both of you have chosen
            a price.
            <ul>
                <li>If you both choose the same price, you will split the market</li>
                <li>If you choose different prices, the player who chose the lower price will earn
                    all of the sales and the other player will make zero sales.</li>
            </ul>
