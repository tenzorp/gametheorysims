            &emsp;In this experiment, you will be asked to make decision in several rounds. You will be randomly paired with
            another person for a sequence of rounds. Each sequence of rounds is referred to as a match. The length of
            a match is randomly determined. After each round, there is a 50% probability that the match will continue
            for at least another round. This is as if we would flip a coin after each round and continue if tails and
            end if heads. So, for instance, if you are in round 2, the probability there will be a third round is 50%
            and if you are in round 9, the probability there will be another round is also 50%. Once a match ends, you
            will be randomly repaired with another person for a new match.
